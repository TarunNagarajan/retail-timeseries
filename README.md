# E-Commerce Retail Forecasting
This project tackles the challenge of forecasting daily sales for a general Indian e-commerce platform. Using the "Generic Indian E-Commerce Data" from Kaggle, we apply both statistical models (ARIMA, Prophet) and deep learning (LSTM) techniques, then ensemble them for improved forecasting performance.
